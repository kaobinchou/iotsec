The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has taken off in a big way and finds itself embedded in our daily lives – from smart home applications to process control monitoring in manufacturing systems, wearables to healthcare, public utilities to military applications, to name just a few. The surge in interest in smart cities increases the scope and reach of IoT-style applications in a significant manner. These applications generate huge volumes of data, have access to personal and confidential information, monitor and control critical processes and are often accessed/controlled via public networks such as the Internet. Hence, they are prime targets for malicious entities and have little to no security mechanisms in place. In addition, most users of such devices/systems are not cognizant of the privacy issues – leakage of personal information for instance, or external entities being able to retrace/recreate our activities from public data obtained through the use of IoT devices/services. On the other hand, onerous security and privacy mechanisms may render these systems useless for most consumers. Hence, there is a need to develop innovative techniques to improve protections for such systems. This is particularly challenging since many IoT systems are often limited in terms of computation power, memory, battery life, bandwidth, etc.

Hence, the goal of IoTSec will be to bring together experts in various areas (security, privacy, embedded systems, sensor networks, etc. along with domains experts from medicine, manufacturing systems, mobile devices and so on) to study and develop security and (usable) privacy mechanisms for next generation IoT systems.

### Keynote: Prof. David M. Nicol, Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

#### **Title: The Role of Modeling and Simulation in IoT Security Research**

**_Abstract:_**
_Many of the challenges of security in IOT relate to scale.  How do we
discover what scaling problems exist?  How do we evaluate solutions to the
problems we foresee?  While measurement of many many IoT devices concurrently
may be possible, what sense can we make of the measurements when so much of 
the IoT infrastructure is opaque to us?  There is a role for modeling and simulation
in assessing security problems and solutions.  This talk highlights the opportunities
and identifies the associated challenges._

**Speaker Bio:**
David M. Nicol is the Franklin W. Woeltge Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign, and Director of the Information Trust Institute (iti.illinois.edu). He is PI for two national centers for infrastructure resilience: the DHS‐funded Critical Infrastructure Reliance Institute (ciri.illinois.edu), and the DoE funded Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery Consortium (cred‐c.org); he is also PI for the Boeing Trusted Software Center, and co-PI for the NSA‐funded Science of Security lablet.  Prior to joining UIUC in 2003 he served on the faculties of the computer science departments at Dartmouth College (1996‐2003), and before that the College of William and Mary (1987‐1996).  He has won recognition for excellence in teaching at all three universities. His research interests include trust analysis of networks and software, analytic modeling, and parallelized discrete‐event simulation, research which has led to the founding of startup company Network Perception, and election as Fellow of the IEEE and Fellow of the ACM. He is the inaugural recipient of the ACM SIGSIM Outstanding Contributions award, and co‐author of the widely used undergraduate textbook "Discrete‐Event Systems Simulation".
