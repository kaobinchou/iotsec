This data frequently includes sensitive information that parties must redact to adhere to laws and user privacy policies. At the same time, there is steady progress on recognizers that find latent information within rich data streams, and thereby create fresh privacy risks. In this work, we advocate the idea of developing a modular, extensible toolkit based on decognizers which are information hiding functions derived from recognizers that redact sensitive information. We offer steps towards an abstract conceptual framework and compositional techniques and discuss requirements for such a toolkit.</div>

One would hope that a full year later, the users and administrators of Internet-facing IoT devices have taken at least the basic measures towards reducing the likelihood that their devices get recruited as facilitators/executors of direct or reflected DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, the results of our recent study involving real-world Webcams are rather discouraging as they show that: 1) with the existence of publicly accessible IoT search engines, such as Shodan, it has become easier than ever for hacker to discover and compromise IoT devices, of any kind and anywhere in the world, and 2) a significant number of Internet-facing Webcams have ‘no’ or ‘likely no’ firewall protection, and are inadequately protected against TCP-SYN floods at the OS-level. The aim of this article is to serve as a wake-up call to the users and administrators of Internet-facing Webcams (as well as other IoT devices), and alert to the need to better protect these devices form being coopted by hackers for purposes of DDoS attacks.

Individuals rarely consider how their personal data is collected, stored or secured. In fact, few of us realize how our daily activities create a significant amount of personal data.  The frequency by which we create personal data is increasing exponentially as we rely more heavily on Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to the internet to provide numerous benefits.  This discussion will examine the legal consequences of collecting personal data gathered from IoT devices from a multinational perspective.

These systems have been shown to be vulnerable to various types of voice spoofing attacks. However, how exactly these techniques differ or relate to each other has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we provide a survey of recent attack and defense techniques for voice controlled systems and propose a classification of these techniques. Further, we also discuss a potential universal defense strategy for different types of attacks. </div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span>Sudip Vhaduri and Christian Poellabauer</span>. </span><span class="title">Implicit Authentication in Wearables Using Multiple Biometrics</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly empowering people with an interconnected world of physical objects ranging from smart buildings to portable smart devices such as wearables. With recent advances in mobile sensing, wearables have become a rich collection of portable sensors and are able to provide various types of services including health and fitness tracking, financial transactions, and unlocking smart locks and vehicles. Existing explicit authentication approaches (i.e., PINs or pattern locks) suffer from several limitations including limited display size or lack of display, shoulder surfing, and recall burden. Oftentimes, users completely disable security features out of convenience. Therefore, there is a need for a burden-free (implicit) authentication mechanism for wearable device users based on easily obtainable biometric data.  In this paper, we present an implicit wearable device user authentication mechanism using combinations of three types of coarse-grained minute-level biometrics: behavioral (step counts), physiological (heart rate), and hybrid (calorie burn and metabolic equivalent of task). From our analysis of 421 Fitbit users from a two-year long health study, we are able to authenticate subjects with average accuracy values of around 92\% and 88\% during {\em sedentary} and {\em non-sedentary} periods, respectively. Our findings also show that (a) behavioral biometrics do not work well during {\em sedentary} periods and (b) hybrid biometrics typically perform better than other biometrics.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span>Chen Cao, Le Guan, Peng Liu, Neng Gao, Jingqiang Lin and Ji Xiang</span>. </span><span class="title">Hey, You, Keep away from My Device: Remotely Implanting a Virus Expeller to Defeat Mirai on IoT Devices</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>Mirai is botnet which targets out-of-date Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The disruptive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in 2016 has hit major Internet companies, causing intermittent service for millions of Internet users. Since the affected devices typically do not support firmware update, it becomes challenging to fix the holes for vulnerable devices in the wild.<br/><br/>Both industry and academia have made great efforts in amending the situation. However, none of these proposals is simple to deploy and at the same time effective in solving the problem. In this work, we design a collaborative<br/>defense strategy to tackle Mirai. Our key idea is to take advantage of human involvement in the least aggressive way. In particular, at a negotiated time slot, a customer is required to reboot the compromised device, then a<br/>``white'' Mirai operated by the manufacturer breaks into the clean-state IoT devices immediately. The ``white'' Mirai expels other malicious Mirai variants, blocks vulnerable ports, and establishes a heartbeat connection with the server operated by the manufacturer. Once the heartbeat is lost, the server re-implants the ``white'' Mirai instantly. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed system, and evaluation results show that our system can evade Mirai attacks effectively.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span><a href="http://www.lisha.ufsc.br/Giovani">Giovani Gracioli</a>, Murray Dunne and Sebastian Fischmeister</span>. </span><span class="title">A Comparison of Data Streaming Frameworks for Anomaly Detection in Embedded Systems</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>As IoT devices are integrated into our daily lives, verification and security become of increasing concern. Using anomaly detection methods, we can identify damaged and compromised devices by examining traces of their activity. Collecting these traces with minimal overhead is a core requirement of any anomaly detection system. We evaluate four publish-subscribe broker systems on their viability for trace collection in the context of IoT devices. Our comparison considers ordering and delivery guarantees, client language support, data structure support, intended use case, and maturity. We run each system on original Raspberry Pis and collect network performance statistics, measuring their capability to collected traces in a resource-constrained embedded systems environment. We conclude with recommendations for designing an anomaly detection system for IoT devices.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span>Safa Boudabous, Stephan Clémençon, Ons Jelassi and Mariona Caros Roca</span>. </span><span class="title">A secure IoT architecture for streaming data analysis and anomaly detection</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>Discovery of repeating temporal patterns and prediction based on time stamped data generated by IoT services raise important methodological issues. A typical predictive problem, addressed in this paper, consists in the early detection
of change points or anomalies, that may be caused by a
malicious use of the system for instance. Although online
anomaly detection is now the subject of much attention in the
data science literature, motivated by crucial industrial applications
such as predictive maintenance and health monitoring
of complex infrastructures, the rapidly changing environment
inherent to most IoT applications makes this task even more
challenging. Beyond the crucial control of the false alarm
rate, the quasi real-time analysis must take into account the
efficiency of computing resources and the possible security
risks in data transfers over the network. We propose here
an architecture for analyzing IoT datastreams data and a
dedicated method for on-line anomaly/novelty detection, based
on nonparametric (mean discrepancy) test statistics and multiple
hypothesis testing techniques. Numerical results based on
experiments involving synthetic datastreams and real energy
consumption datastreams provides empirical evidence of the
relevance of the methodology proposed.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span><a href="http://ebelenwaf.github.io">Ebelechukwu Nwafor</a>, Andre Campbell and <a href="http://gedare.github.io">Gedare Bloom</a></span>. </span><span class="title">Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection of IoT Device Sensor Data using Provenance Graphs</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way humans interact with devices. Unfortunately, this technological revolution has been met with privacy and security challenges. One major concern is the notion of malicious intrusions. A common way of detecting a malicious intrusion is by treating an attack as an anomaly and using anomaly detection techniques to detect the source of intrusion. In a given IoT device, provenance, which denotes causality between system events, offers immense benefit for intrusion detection. Provenance provides a comprehensive history of activity performed on a system’s data, which indirectly ensures device trust. In this paper, we propose an approach to intrusion detection of IoT devices that leverages sensor data flow as seen through provenance graphs. In this approach, an observed provenance graph is compared to an application’s known provenance graph. This comparison involves the dimensionality reduction of a provenance graph to a vector space representation and similarity metric. We evaluated our approach on an IoT application which simulates a climate control system.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span><a href="https://haddadi.github.io/">Hamed Haddadi</a>, Vassilis Christophides, Renata Cruz Teixeira, Kenjiro Cho, Shigeya Suzuki and Adrian Perrig</span>. </span><span class="title">SIOTOME: An Edge-ISP Collaborative Architecture for IoT Security</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>Today we are observing an increasing rate in the introduction of connected, Internet of Things (IoT) devices in our personal and public environments. These devices range from voice-enabled personal
<br/>assistants, entertainment systems, health monitoring devices, infrastructure monitoring equipment, the quantified self sector, to personal devices.
<br/>
<br/>In this paper we propose a novel, cooperative system between the home gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to provide data driven security solutions for detecting and isolating IoT security attacks. Our approach is based on a combination of a large-scale view from the ISP (using powerful machine learning techniques on traffic traces), and the fine-grained view of the per-device activity from the home to provide efficient, yet privacy-aware IoT security services.

Significant efficiencies are gained from this ecosystem that automates many aspects of everyday life. Unfortunately, this automation often occults the understanding of causes and effects of actions taken in an IoT network (including those of rogue devices). As we observe the effects of a particular device’s actions on its environment (e.g., the light turns on), we want to capture the full causality path to the originating device. This paper describes a promising approach that enables one to infer a potential sequence of actions (or any deviation thereof) that led to a particular observation.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span>Daniel Sanchez and Bogdan Copos</span>. </span><span class="title">Cognitive Enhancement as an Attack Surface</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>Imagine that an attacker with an off-the-shelf Blue- tooth exploit could go beyond gaining access to your connected devices, and directly manipulate the neurons in your brain. The emergence of wearable Internet-of-Things devices has introduced consumer-available neural stimulator devices that are capable of modulating brain activity and function. The level of stimulation varies; from seemingly innocuous sound stimulation to electrical current delivered to the scalp. We outline how these new stimulation technologies are opening the door to a novel type of attack surface. One use case shows how it is possible to manipulate stimulation parameters with off-the-shelf Bluetooth man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. Another scenario outlines a risk analysis conducted during development of an auditory sleep enhancement system. Lastly, we discuss safeguards and recommendations to address the emerging threats related to the nascent market of consumer wearables with actuation capabilities.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><span>Abhinav Mohanty, Islam Obaidat, Fadi Yilmaz and <a href="http://webpages.uncc.edu/msridhar/">Meera Sridhar</a></span>. </span><span class="title">Control-hijacking Vulnerabilities in IoT Firmware: A Brief Survey</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>Security issues in the Internet of Things (IoT) are rapidly growing. While much recent research has focused on network security, authentication, authorization, protocol, web and mobile (interfaces for IoT devices) security, less attention has been devoted to software vulnerabilities, especially in IoT firmware. As a first step towards gathering research community attention and developing robust defenses, we present a classification of recently discovered control-hijacking vulnerabilities in select IoT firmware.</div><div class="paper"><span class="authors"><a href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/~hui/">Hui Lin</a>. </span><span class="title">SDN-based In-network Honeypot: Preemptively Disrupt and Mislead Attacks in IoT Networks</span></div><div class="abstract"><b>Abstract: </b>Detecting cyber attacks in the network environments used by Internet-of-things (IoT) and preventing them from causing physical perturbations play an important role in delivering dependable services. To achieve this goal, we propose in-network Honeypot based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to disrupt and mislead adversaries into exposures while they are in an early stage of preparing an attack. Different from traditional Honeypot requiring dedicated hardware setup, the in-network Honeypot directly reroutes traffic from suspicious nodes and intelligently spoofs the network traffic to them by adding misleading information into normal traffic. Preliminary evaluations on real networks demonstrate that the in-network Honeypot can have little impacts on the performance of IoT networks.</div></body>
